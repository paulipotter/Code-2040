# Code-2040 Fellows Application: The API Challenge

Hi friend!

This repo is for the Code 2040 API Challenge Fellows Application

[**Code 2040**](https://www.code2040.org/ "Code 2040") is a great NGO that "creates pathways to educational, professional, and entrepreneurial success in technology for underrepresented minorities with a specific focus on Blacks and Latino/as."

Each file is a different step in the process.
#### Step 1: Set up a repository and make a HTTP POST request.
#### Step 2: Reverse a string.
#### Step 3: Find the _needle in the haystack_ and send back the index of the needle string.
#### Step 4: Make a new array that ommits all words that starts with the given prefix.
#### Step 5: Add a given amount of seconds (stored in an integer value) to a _ISO 8601_ datestamp

####What I learned in the process: 
* How to properly read documentation and properly use an API
* HTTP Post requests (_requests_, _urllib3_)
* JSON!
* How great Python is
