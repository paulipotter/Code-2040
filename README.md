# Code-2040 Fellows Application: The API Challenge

Hi friend!

This repo is for the Code 2040 API Challenge Fellows Application

###### [**Code 2040**](https://www.code2040.org/ "Code 2040") is a great NGO that "creates pathways to educational, professional, and entrepreneurial success in technology for underrepresented minorities with a specific focus on Blacks and Latino/as."

Each file is a different step in the process.

What I learned in the process: 
* How to properly read documentation and properly use an API
* HTTP Post requests (_requests_, _urllib3_)
* JSON!
* How great Python is
